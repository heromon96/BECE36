Java Packages

- A java package is group of classes and interfaces which are
  related to one single module in the given project.

 Package naming convention

 * package name is always written in all-lowercase.

* package names are always written in reverse order of domain

  convention 1
  domain.appname.modulename
  com.gmail.inbox  

  convention 2
  domain.companyname.appname.modulename
  com.google.gmail.inbox
  
  
To Access properties of a class in different package we have 2 ways

 1. using fully qualified class name
 2. import statement.
 
 
 Fully qualified class name : A class name which is written with its package name.
                             
                        syntax : packagename.classname
  
  
 Access Specifiers
 
 - Access specifiers are used to provide security for the classes and its members
   by controlling the visibility.
 
   * Public
   - if you declare any entity as public , then it can be accessed from any
     classes present in any package.
   - Public entities will have highest visibility and lowest security.
  
   * Protected
   - if you declare any entity as protected , then it can be accessed only from 
     classes present in same package.
     
   - Protected entities of a class can be accessed by other classes present in
     different package by Inheritance and creating the object of Subclass.
  
  
   * Pkg-level (default)
   - If you declare any entity without using any access specifier keywords
     then that entity is called as pkg-level member or default member.
     
   - if you declare any entity as pkg-level , then it can be accessed STRICTLY
     by the classes present in SAME PACKAGE ONLY.
  
   * Private 
   
   - if you declare any entity as private , then it can be accessed ONLY
     within the class in which they are declared.
     
   - Private entities will have highest security and lowest visibility.
  
  
   Encapsulation
  
   - Providing security for data members by Declaring them as private 
     and grant the access through getter and setter methods is called 
     Encapsulation.
     
   - Getter methods returns current value of the private data member.
   
   - Return type of the getter method depends on data type of private data member.
   
   - Setter methods updates value of the private data member.
   
   - Return type of the setter method will be usally declared as void.
     But it can be changed according application requirement.
     
   - Encapsulation is used to protect the data members of the class against
     the invalid value.
